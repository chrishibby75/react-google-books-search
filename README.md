# NYT Google Books Search

## Overview
This app allows the user to search for books via Google and then save any books of interest.  You may also view any book that you like and this will direct you to the Google page for that specific book.  

## Details
This is a MERN app using React.js, MongoDB, Express and Node.  In the developer environment, it runs off of two local servers concurrently.  It renders components for the front end and uses a series of API calls to connect on the back end.  Click [here](https://github.com/chrishibby75/react-google-books-search) to view the code.
